# MIT CERTIFICATION MODULE 7 - PACMEN EXERCISE

## Description

This exercise is a factory that spawns a pacman on the screen via a button.  Each pacman spawns in a random position in the viewport.  Once the game is started, via a button, each pacman gets a random velocity and begins to change position, according to that velocity, both horizontally and vertically.  Each time a pacman reaches the edge of the window (top & bottom or sides), it reverses direction.

## Exercise Task

I was given a starter.html code.  I had to complete the code to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div when the button "Add PacMan" is pressed. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.

I also had to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits by reversing direction.

## How To Run

You will need the index.html, pacmen.js and the pacman images in order to run this factory and play the game.

## Roadmap To Future Improvements

I would like to add code to have the pacman appear to open and close its mouth while moving in both directions.
